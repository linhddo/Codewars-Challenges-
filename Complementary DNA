'''Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" 
for the development and functioning of living organisms.
If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of 
each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA 
(string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. 
DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).'''

# We can't replace all letters at once, since that way, we will double/triple replace with each iteration  

def DNA_strand(dna):
    dna_coding = {'A':'T', 
                 'T':'A', 
                 'C':'G', 
                 'G':'C'} #create a dictionary for dna coding 
    dna_comp = '' #new empty string to prevent overwrite 
    for char in dna: 
        dna_comp += dna_coding[char] #return value at appropriate key in dict
    return dna_comp
