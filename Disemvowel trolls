'''Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".'''

def disemvowel(string):
    new_string = '' #create new string 
    for s in string: #loop through string 
        if s not in 'aeiouAEIOU': 
            new_string += s #if character not vowel, add to new string 
    return new_string

#Y is not a vowel accoriding to codewars
